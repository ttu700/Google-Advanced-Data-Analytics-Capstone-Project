## Course Overview
Course 1: Foundations: Data, Data, Everywhere
This introductory course provides a comprehensive overview of the field of data analytics. It introduces core responsibilities, emphasizing the fundamental data analysis process. Key analytical tools such as SQL and Excel are covered, along with essential analytical skills. The course explores the data life cycle, offering a solid initiation into data analysis through videos, readings, and interactive assignments.

Course 2: Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions
Focusing on the "Ask" stage of data analysis, this course teaches the art of formulating impactful questions for data-driven decision-making. Foundational concepts related to Excel and Google Sheets are covered, along with understanding stakeholders and managing their expectations.

Course 3: Prepare Data for Exploration
This course delves into the second phase of data analysis: Preparation. Topics include data collection intricacies, various data formats, and ethical considerations. Learners gain insights into data types, structures, foundational SQL practices, and hands-on experience through Qwiklabs.

Course 4: Process Data from Dirty to Clean
Covering the third step of data analysis, Data Processing, this course explores data-cleaning tools, spreadsheet functions in Google Sheets, and advanced SQL. Practical quizzes and hands-on experiences enhance learners' data manipulation skills, with a concluding section offering valuable resume advice.

Course 5: Analyze Data to Answer Questions
The fourth step, "Analyze," is the focus of this course. Learners apply knowledge to real-world scenarios, working with authentic datasets. Spreadsheet calculations, Pivot tables, advanced SQL concepts, and data calculations enrich analytical capabilities.

Course 6: Share Data Through the Art of Visualization
Introducing the "Share" step, this course covers data visualization principles, design elements, and an introduction to Tableau. Learners gain practical experience creating visualizations and effectively communicating data-driven insights.

Course 7: Data Analysis with R Programming
Foundational introduction to R programming, covering essential topics like functions, variables, vectors, and data types. The course concludes with an exploration of R Markdown for data analysis and report generation.

Course 8: Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study
The capstone course involves the practical application of knowledge through a comprehensive case study. Participants enhance job-hunting skills with insightful videos covering common interview questions and effective responses. Valuable resources are provided for building an impressive online portfolio.

## Conclusion
This course series offers an enjoyable and user-friendly learning experience, providing a foundational understanding of the data analyst role and essential tools. While it covers theoretical concepts, additional learning and practice beyond the program may be necessary for full job readiness. The program is an excellent starting point for those interested in a career in data analytics, providing the fundamental skills needed in the industry.
